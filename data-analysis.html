            <p>I‚Äôm excited to share my latest Power BI project! 
              As part of my DMBI (Data Mining & Business Intelligence) subject in college, I created a complete Restaurant Sales Dashboard to analyze and visualize key insights from a fast-food business.
              üìä Project Overview:
              The dashboard provides a deep dive into restaurant operations using various interactive visuals and charts.
              üìÅ Dataset Used:
              Balaji Fast Food Sales Dataset
              Source: Kaggle
              This dashboard was built as part of my academic project to apply real-world BI concepts using Power BI. I aimed to extract actionable insights from restaurant sales data and practice building visually clear, business-friendly dashboards.
              üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
              Power BI
              DAX
              Power Query
              Data Visualization Best Practices
              Feel free to check it out and share your thoughts! </p>

            <p>Virat Kohli Career Statistics Dashboard

              Excited to share my Second Power BI project! 
              I have created a comprehensive dashboard visualizing Virat Kohli's incredible cricket journey from 2008 to 2025. This interactive dashboard showcases key statistics, including his career average, strike rate, boundaries breakdown, runs scored over the years, and the distribution of hundreds and fifties.
              
              It highlights his consistent performance across formats (ODI, Test, T20I) and his contribution as one of cricket's greatest players.
              
              The insights are presented through visually appealing and intuitive graphs, making it easy to analyze his legendary career.
              
              Feedback and suggestions are most welcome! </p>
